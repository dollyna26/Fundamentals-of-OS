ðŸ“˜ Operating System (OS) â€” Detailed Notes


## 1. Introduction

*Definition:*
An *Operating System (OS)* is a system software that acts as an interface between the *user* and the *computer hardware*. It manages hardware resources, provides services to application programs, and enables convenient user interaction.

*Key Responsibilities of an OS:*

| Function              | Description                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Process Management    | Handles creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.              |
| Memory Management     | Allocates and manages primary memory (RAM), paging, segmentation.        |
| File Management       | Manages files, directories, and access rights.                           |
| I/O Device Management | Controls and coordinates input/output devices.                           |
| Security & Protection | Ensures authentication, authorization, and access control.               |
| User Interface        | Provides CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface). |

## 2. Types of Operating Systems

| Type                | Description                                              | Example           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Batch OS            | Executes jobs in batches without user interaction.       | Early IBM systems |
| Time-Sharing OS     | Many users share CPU time; supports multitasking.        | UNIX              |
| Real-Time OS (RTOS) | Provides deterministic response for time-critical tasks. | VxWorks, QNX      |
| Distributed OS      | Multiple machines work as a single system.               | Amoeba, LOCUS     |
| Multiprogramming OS | Multiple programs in memory, executed concurrently.      | Mainframe systems |
| Multitasking OS     | Multiple tasks per user, running simultaneously.         | Windows, Linux    |
| Mobile OS           | Optimized for mobile devices.                            | Android, iOS      |

## 3. Process Management

### Process

A *process* is a program in execution that includes program counter, registers, stack, and allocated resources.

### Process States

    [*] --> New
    New --> Ready
    Ready --> Running
    Running --> Waiting
    Waiting --> Ready
    Running --> Terminated


*Explanation of States:*

* *New:* Process is being created.
* *Ready:* Process waiting to be assigned to CPU.
* *Running:* Process is currently being executed.
* *Waiting:* Process waiting for I/O or resource.
* *Terminated:* Process finished execution.

### CPU Scheduling Algorithms

| Algorithm                     | Description                             | Advantage                      | Disadvantage                      |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| FCFS (First Come First Serve) | Processes executed in order of arrival. | Simple to implement.           | Poor performance for short jobs.  |
| SJF (Shortest Job First)      | Shortest burst time first.              | Minimizes waiting time.        | May cause starvation.             |
| Round Robin (RR)              | Equal time slice for all processes.     | Fair, good for time-sharing.   | High context-switching overhead.  |
| Priority Scheduling           | Higher priority â†’ executed first.       | Critical tasks get preference. | Starvation of low priority tasks. |

## 4. Threads

*Definition:*
A *thread* is the smallest unit of CPU execution within a process.

*Advantages of Threads:*

* Faster context switching compared to processes.
* Efficient resource utilization (share memory).
* Better concurrency for multiprocessor systems.

*Types of Threads:*

* *User-level Threads:* Managed by user libraries, faster but no kernel support.
* *Kernel-level Threads:* Managed by OS kernel, slower but more powerful.

---

## 5. Memory Management

### Techniques

* *Contiguous Allocation:* Fixed or variable partitions of memory.
* *Paging:* Divides memory into fixed-size frames and processes into pages.
* *Segmentation:* Divides memory into variable-sized logical segments.
* *Virtual Memory:* Uses disk as an extension of RAM (demand paging).

### Page Replacement Algorithms

| Algorithm | Working Principle                                 | Advantage          | Disadvantage                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| FIFO      | Replace oldest page.                              | Simple             | May replace frequently used pages.                 |
| LRU       | Replace least recently used page.                 | Good performance   | Requires tracking history.                         |
| Optimal   | Replace page not used for longest time in future. | Lowest page faults | Not possible in practice (needs future knowledge). |

## 6. Deadlock

*Definition:*
A *deadlock* is a situation where processes wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.

*Coffman Conditions (must hold for deadlock to occur):*

1. Mutual Exclusion
2. Hold and Wait
3. No Preemption
4. Circular Wait

*Deadlock Handling Methods:*

* *Prevention:* Ensure one condition never holds.
* *Avoidance:* Use Bankerâ€™s Algorithm (check safe state).
* *Detection & Recovery:* Detect cycle, terminate/restart processes.

### Deadlock Example Diagram

## 7. File System

*Operations:*

* Create, Open, Read, Write, Close, Delete files.

*Directory Structures:*

| Structure       | Description                             |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Single-level    | All files in one directory.             |
| Two-level       | Each user has their own directory.      |
| Tree-structured | Hierarchical directories (most common). |
| Graph-based     | Allows sharing using links.             |

---

## 8. I/O Management

*Techniques:*

* *Buffering:* Temporary storage during transfer.
* *Caching:* Storing frequently used data.
* *Spooling:* Overlap I/O with CPU by queuing jobs.

*Device Drivers:* Provide abstraction for hardware devices.

---

## 9. Security & Protection

*Goals:*

* *Confidentiality:* Protect data from unauthorized access.
* *Integrity:* Ensure data is not tampered.
* *Availability:* Ensure system is available when needed.

*Techniques:*

* Authentication (passwords, biometrics).
* Authorization (permissions, ACLs).
* Encryption (data protection).
* Firewalls, antivirus, secure kernels.
